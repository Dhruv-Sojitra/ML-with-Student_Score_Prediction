# ML-with-Student_Score_Prediction
🎓 Student Score Prediction

This project predicts students’ academic scores based on various input features using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze how different factors affect student performance and to build a predictive model that estimates scores accurately.

📌 Project Overview

Educational institutions often want to understand the factors influencing student performance. This project applies data analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict student scores based on available data such as study hours, attendance, or other academic indicators.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing and exploration

Feature selection

Model training and evaluation

Prediction of student scores

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📊 Machine Learning Workflow

Data Loading

Importing the dataset

Inspecting data structure and summary statistics

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature scaling (if required)

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing relationships between features

Identifying trends and correlations

Model Building

Applying regression algorithms

Training the model on training data

Model Evaluation

Measuring performance using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Prediction

Predicting student scores for new or test data

📈 Results

The trained model demonstrates how student-related factors influence academic performance and provides reasonably accurate score predictions. Performance metrics are displayed within the notebook.

🔮 Future Improvements
